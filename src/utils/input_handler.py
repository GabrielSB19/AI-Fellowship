class TextHandler:
    """
    Handles text-related operations including language detection, translation (placeholder),
    and emotion description based on emotion prediction results.

    Attributes:
        emotion_mapping (dict): A mapping from predicted class IDs to tuples containing the
                                corresponding emotion and a descriptive message.

    Methods:
        __init__()
            Initializes the TextHandler instance with predefined emotion mappings.

        translate_from_spanish(text: str) -> str
            Translates the provided text from Spanish to English. Currently a placeholder
            that requires implementation.

        detect_language(text: str) -> (str, str)
            Detects the language of the given text using the langdetect library and
            translates it if it's in Spanish.

        get_emotion_description(predicted_class_id: int, input_language: str = 'en') -> (str, str)
            Maps a predicted class ID to its corresponding emotion and description,
            translating the description to Spanish if originally detected so.
