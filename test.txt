And yet,
despite the fact that it didn't have to be that way,
it happened.

Life went on,
everyone decided to forget about it,
but one kept it present.

What was it,
that caused sleepless nights?
a continuous thought,
that seemed not to disappear.

But that didn't matter,
his concern was one,
lost in the sea of lights,
one more glimmer in eternity.

It was enough for him to learn,
that life,
always changes.
