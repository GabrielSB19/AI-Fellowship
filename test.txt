I finished the calculus assignment, I'm not sure if it was fun, but what I did do was describe a new way in which I pushed myself quite a bit, you know, a new level...
 Also, grateful to the one above that I finished challenge 8, learning certain little things,which I will describe below.
  I felt a little bad for taking code for the second encryption method, but nevertheless today (23rd) I reflected on that's how things work.
   For example, research is recycling knowledge from others to create new knowledge, and well, I did something like that. 
   From the concept of bitshifting, and 2 lines of code, I created a program that encrypts and decrypts the desired information.
Finally, I did my guitar lesson (I feel like it improved a bit), and on the 23rd morning I went cycling, after a long time. I feel like this is the beginning of THE AWAKENING OF THE CYCLIST.
It can always be worse, don't beat yourself up so much about what you haven't done, you have your own pace, and remember that there will always be someone in a worse condition than you.
It can always be better, calculus for example is the signal that interesting challenges are coming (sometimes not so easy), but that will always make you learn more.
Sometimes it's good to ask for help (e.g. the code), as long as the final goal is to create something better, and reference it respectively.
It's difficult at first, but it gets easier little by little. It's never easy to start something, but little by little you get the hang of it.
