In fields of sunlight, joy takes flight,
A melody of laughter, hearts take light.
Smiles bloom like blossoms, fresh and new,
Happiness awakens, dreams come true.

In nature's embrace, worries cease,
A symphony of beauty, bringing peace.
Gratitude's warm touch, a gentle grace,
Happiness abounds, in every space.

In moments cherished, big or small,
Happiness blossoms, answering love's call.
A treasure within, a guiding star,
Happiness radiates, near and far.
